# AutoLogin Extension

A lightweight browser extension that automates the login process for institutional or corporate Wi-Fi networks that require authentication via a captive portal (commonly hosted at a specific IP address).

Instead of typing your credentials every time you connect to Wi-Fi, this extension injects a script into the authentication page and logs you in automatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. On connecting to your institute/MNC Wi-Fi, the captive portal opens in the browser.
2. The extension listens for requests to the **authentication IP page**.
3. When detected, it injects a custom script that:
   - Populates the login form fields.
   - Clicks the login/submit button automatically.
4. You‚Äôre connected without touching a key.
